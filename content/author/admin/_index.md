My main focus areas are graph theory (e.g., coloring), algorithms (e.g., parameterization), and complexity (e.g., lower bounds). I also enjoy programming and solving computationally difficult problems in practice.

I successfully defended my doctoral thesis on 3rd of November, 2016. My opponent was Pinar Heggernes (University of Bergen). From May 2015 to May 2017, I was supported by the Emil Aaltonen Foundation.
            
In May 2017, I joined Bell Labs in Dublin, Ireland as a post-doctoral researcher.
