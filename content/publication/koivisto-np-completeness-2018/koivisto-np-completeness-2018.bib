 abstract = {A *total domatic \$k\$-partition* of a graph is a partition of its vertex set into k subsets such that each intersects the open neighborhood of each vertex. The maximum k for which a total domatic k-partition exists is known as the total domatic number of a graph G, denoted by \$\text\d_t\(G)\$. We extend considerably the known hardness results by showing it is NP-complete to decide whether \$\text\d_t\(G) \geq 3\$  where \$G\$ is a bipartite planar graph of bounded maximum degree. Similarly, for every \$k \geq 3\$, it is NP-complete to decide whether \$\text\d_t\(G) \geq k\$, where \$G\$ is split or \$k\$-regular. In particular, these results complement recent combinatorial results regarding  \$\text\d_t\(G)\$ on some of these graph classes by showing that the known results are, in a sense, best possible. Finally, for general n-vertex graphs, we show the problem is solvable in \$2\textasciicircumn n\textasciicircum\O(1)\\$ time, and derive even faster algorithms for special graph classes.},
