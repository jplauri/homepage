abstract = "A *total domatic $k$-partition* of a graph is a partition of its vertex set into k subsets such that each intersects the open neighborhood of each vertex. The maximum k for which a total domatic k-partition exists is known as the total domatic number of a graph G, denoted by $textd_t(G)$. We extend considerably the known hardness results by showing it is NP-complete to decide whether $textd_t(G) geq 3$  where $G$ is a bipartite planar graph of bounded maximum degree. Similarly, for every $k geq 3$, it is NP-complete to decide whether $textd_t(G) geq k$, where $G$ is split or $k$-regular. In particular, these results complement recent combinatorial results regarding  $textd_t(G)$ on some of these graph classes by showing that the known results are, in a sense, best possible. Finally, for general n-vertex graphs, we show the problem is solvable in $2textasciicircumn ntextasciicircumO(1)$ time, and derive even faster algorithms for special graph classes."
