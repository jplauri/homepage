abstract = "In the graph motif problem, we are given as input a vertex-colored graph $H$ (the host graph) and a multiset of colors $M$ (the motif). Our task is to decide whether $H$ has a connected set of vertices whose multiset of colors agrees with M. The graph motif problem is NP-complete but known to admit parameterized algorithms that run in linear time in the size of $H$. We demonstrate that algorithms based on constrained multilinear sieving are viable in practice, scaling to graphs with hundreds of millions of edges as long as $M$ remains small. Furthermore, our implementation is topology-invariant relative to the host graph $H$, meaning only the most crude graph parameters (number of edges and number of vertices) suffice in practice to determine the algorithm performance."
