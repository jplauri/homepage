 abstract = {The \$n\$-hypercube, denoted by \$Q_n\$, has a vertex for each bit string of length \$n\$ with two vertices adjacent whenever their Hamming distance is one. The minimum number of colors needed to color \$Q_n\$ such that no two vertices at a distance at most \$k\$ receive the same color is denoted by \$ḩi_\\bar\k\\(n)\$. Equivalently, \$\i̧_\\bar\k\\(n)\$ denotes the minimum number of binary codes with minimum distance at least \$k+1\$ required to partition the \$n\$-dimensional Hamming space. Using a computer search, we improve upon the known upper bound for \$n=9\$ by showing that \$13 \leq \c_̧\\bar\2\\(9) \leq 14\$.},
