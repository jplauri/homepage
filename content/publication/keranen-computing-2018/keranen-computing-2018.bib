 abstract = {A path in an edge-colored graph \$G\$ is rainbow if no two edges of it are colored the same. The graph \$G\$ is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow path between every pair of vertices. If there is a rainbow shortest path between every pair of vertices, the graph \$G\$ is strongly rainbow-connected. The minimum number of colors needed to make \$G\$ rainbow-connected is known as the rainbow connection number of \$G\$, and is denoted by \$\text\rc\(G)\$. Similarly, the minimum number of colors needed to make \$G\$ strongly rainbow-connected is known as the strong rainbow connection number of \$G\$, and is denoted by \$\text\src\(G)\$. We prove that for every \$k \geq 3\$, deciding whether \$\text\src\(G) \leq k\$ is NP-complete for split graphs, which form a subclass of chordal graphs. Furthermore, there exists no polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the strong rainbow connection number of an \$n\$-vertex split graph with a factor of \$n\textasciicircum\1/2-\epsilon\\$ for any \$\epsilon \textgreater 0\$ unless P = NP. We then turn our attention to block graphs, which also form a subclass of chordal graphs. We determine the strong rainbow connection number of block graphs, and show it can be computed in linear time. Finally, we provide a polynomial-time characterization of bridgeless block graphs with rainbow connection number at most 4.},
