 abstract = {The Rainbow \$k\$-Coloring problem asks whether the edges of a given graph can be colored in \$k\$ colors so that every pair of vertices is connected by a rainbow path, i.e., a path with all edges of different colors. Our main result states that for any \$k\ge 2\$, there is no algorithm for Rainbow \$k\$-Coloring running in time \$2\textasciicircum\o(n\textasciicircum\3/2\)\\$, unless the exponential time hypothesis fails. Motivated by this negative result we consider two parameterized variants of the problem. In the Subset Rainbow \$k\$-Coloring problem, introduced by Chakraborty et al. [J. Comb. Optim., 21 (2009), pp. 330--347], we are additionally given a set \$S\$ of pairs of vertices and we ask if there is a coloring in which all the pairs in \$S\$ are connected by rainbow paths. We show that Subset Rainbow \$k\$-Coloring is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by \$\textbarS\textbar\$. We also study the Maximum Rainbow \$k\$-Coloring problem, where we are additionally given an integer \$q\$, and we ask if there is a coloring in which at least \$q\$ anti-edges are connected by rainbow paths. We show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by \$q\$ and has a kernel of size \$O(q)\$ for every \$k\ge 2\$, extending the result of Ananth, Nasre, and Sarpatwar, in FSTTCS, LIPIcs, Schloss Dagstuhl--Leibniz-Zentum für Informatik, Dagstuhl, Germany, 2011, pp. 241--251. We believe that our techniques used for the lower bounds may shed some light on the complexity of the classical Edge Coloring problem, where it is a major open question if a \$2\textasciicircum\O(n)\\$-time algorithm exists.},
